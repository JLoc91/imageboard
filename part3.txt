        Needs to be a component!! Register the component with Vue in app.js. --> DONE!
        Render the component inside #main in your index.html and render the component with its own custom tag (e.g. <my-component></my-component> --> DONE!
        you want to have a property in Vue instance's data object that is responsible for determining whether or not the component should be onscreen. If that property is truthy, show it! Otherwise, hide it.
            that property name should be your image id! --> DONE!
                if the id is null or 0, then it should be hidden! --> DONE!
                    when you click on an image, set the value of the imageId to be the id of the image you just clicked! --> DONE!
                    if your id is a valid number, then it is truthy and because of your v-if check, your component will automatically show up. --> DONE! but doesnt mean that an actual image is shown

    2. Getting the modal to render the image the user clicked on (as well as title, description, and username)
        In the Vue instance, we will know which image was clicked on! Pass the id of the image that was clicked on to the component as a prop. --> DONE!
            In the Vue component, use the props array to get access to the info being passed down by the parent. --> DONE!
            in index.html, we have to pass the image id prop from the vue instance to the component as a custom attribute (i.e. :id='id') --> DONE!
            if you pass down a prop successfully and you console.log this.PROPNAME inside your mounted function of your component that is receiving it, you should see the value!! (the id of the image) --> DONE!
            in the mounted function of the component, make a fetch request to the server to get additional information about the image the user clicked on (url, title, description, username, created_at) --> DONE!
            once you receive a response from the server, render the image onscreen. --> DONE!

    3. Closing the modal
        In your component, $emit an event when the user tries to close the modal (when x icon is clicked). --> DONE!
        In your index.html, listen for that custom event, and trigger a funciton to run on app.js when the event fires --> DONE!
        In you Vue instance (app.js), the method that run should close the modal by setting the image id to a falsey value (null or 0 is fine). --> DONE!

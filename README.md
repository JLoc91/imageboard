# imageboard

This repository contains my 3rd project which I developed at SPICED-ACADEMY.
Stack: Vue.js | Express | Node | PostgreSQL

It's an imageboard which is developed as a single page application. The frontend is developed in Vue.js and the backend in Node.js.

The user can upload a picture (will be uploaded to an AWS bucket) and add a title, description and username. The most recent picture will be shown first. When you click on one of the pictures, you can leave a comment and read comments.
